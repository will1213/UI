            <h1>Potential Project Ideas</h1>
            <h2 class='content-h2'>Price Comparison Website</h2>
            <p class='content-p'>Our first project idea is a price comparison website. This service will solve the issue
                of trying to find the best price for a product when shopping online. Often, it is difficult when
                shopping online to find good deals, sales, or even compare prices between various stores. This project
                will collect and show all the important pricing information from multiple merchants in order to provide
                the user a simple and easy way to navigate through prices on the website. Things like price graphs over
                time, sales, and store availability will be shown to the user to help them make their decision. Filters
                will also be implemented to sort whether a product can be ordered online or picked up in person. When
                comparing this service to competitors, the main difference and improvement it brings is that it will
                show specific searched items rather than a wide list of related items. We will also be able to compare
                retailers based on shippable items or in-store pickup availability, depending on the urgency of the
                item. Along with that general information that could include a description, reviews, and news about the
                item can be shown in order to pass on as much information to the user.</p>
            <h2 class='content-h2'>Modernized Cash Register Software</h2>
            <p class='content-p'>Our second project idea is to create a modernized cash register software. By
                modernized, we mean a software that not only looks aesthetically pleasing but also practices the latest
                principles of HCI and UX design. The reason for this objective is because most cash register software
                still use old-style UI elements and design principles. By doing a quick search for the best cash
                register software on the internet and taking a look at some of their UI, it is clear that most of them
                look dated by today's standards. Though some might make the argument "if it ain't broke, don't fix it",
                just because something has worked for a long time, does not mean it always will or that it cannot be
                improved. For example, a cash register software with a dated UI could create a steep learning curve for
                younger people who have only been exposed to newer operating systems, such as Windows 10, or have only
                used smartphones, which have very modern and sleek UI designs. Also, most cash register software are
                designed for a very general group of users. As a result, if a user does not require all features of a
                generalized cash register software, there is no option to hide these features, which leads to extra
                clutter in the UI. As for how we will address these issues, we plan to design a desktop application for
                our cash register software, in which we will upgrade the UI from a Windows XP look to a much more modern
                look. Regarding the issue with extra clutter due to a generalized cash register software, we plan to add
                a feature that will allow us to customize the UI based on what users need. These two main improvements,
                along with others that we come up along the way, will allow us to create a modernized cash register
                software that is both easier to learn and use.</p>
            <h2 class='content-h2'>Streaming Service Compiler Website with Social Features</h2>
            <p class='content-p'>Our third project idea is a website for compiling a variety of streaming services. With
                many major companies releasing their own streaming services (Netflix, Prime Video, HBO, Disney+, etc.),
                it can be a hassle to figure out which streaming service a movie is on. Browsing movies can also be a
                pain because you cannot look through the libraries across all your subscriptions at once. To fix this
                problem, our team would aggregate the libraries of all the streaming services on a single website. Users
                would link all their accounts to the website, and the library would be filtered down to the libraries of
                these services. If a user searches for a movie that they do not have access to, the website could
                quickly let them know which services has it. This would allow for a user to seamlessly browse through or
                search for movies without switching websites. This website would also have social features, such as a
                friends list, to allow users to see what their friends are watching or even join in on the movie, if
                they have access to it. This would make it easy for users to set up watch parties with their friends.
