# Stage two tasks:


## Description of project idea 
Our project idea is astreaming service. However, unlike other streaming services where a limited number of movies and shows isavailable, ours will compile all media from a variety of streaming services into one convenient location. It will be made available through a website, as well as have an accompanying mobile applicationto enable  users  to  access  their movies  and  shows  on the  go.  By  allowing  users  to  link  their streaming services to ours, users will be able to browse through the libraries of all their streaming services and watch their favorite movies and shows seamlessly. Furthermore, users will be able to search for media across services, compare ratings, and manage watchlists all within our service. Finally, there will be social features included, which would allow users to see what their friends are watching and even watchwith them. This service is targeted towards people who are  subscribed to multiple streaming services, as its purpose is to simplify searching and trackingmovies and shows across streaming services
