            <h1>Heuristic Evaluation</h1>
            <h2 class='content-h2'>Process</h2>
            <p class='content-p'>Our evaluators used Nielsen and Molich’s 10 User Interface Design Heuristics to
                evaluate the four currently prototyped user tasks in our project. As mentioned before, the user tasks we
                prototyped include: (1) browsing libraries of movies and shows, (2) searching for specific movies and
                shows, (3) watching movies and shows using an embedded video player, and (4) aggregating and displaying
                ratings of movies and shows. Each evaluator independently performed the four user tasks through our
                high-fidelity prototype and recorded the issues they experienced while also including details regarding
                which usability heuristics were violated. The remaining team members (i.e., reviewers) then reviewed and
                analyzed the evaluators’ observations, rating each issue on a scale of severity from 0 (non-issue) to 4
                (usability catastrophe). After the evaluators and reviewers independently completed their tasks, all
                members came together to discuss the issues and brainstorm ideas to resolve them.</p>
            <h2 class='content-h2'>Findings</h2>
            <p class='content-p'>After the evaluators completed their heuristic evaluation documents, they presented
                them to the reviewers to review and analyze. While working separately, each reviewer created a table in
                which they listed the issues that were observed by the evaluators, as well as the usability heuristics
                the issues violated and the severity of the violations. Once the reviewers completed their tables, they
                aggregated their data into one table to more simply showcase the issues found by the evaluators. After
                this, all members of the team met up to discuss the findings and determine which issues needed to be
                fixed in this iteration. Through this process, we found 11 issues with our prototype, which violated a
                usability heuristic from Nielsen and Molich’s 10 User Interface Design Heuristics. For the most part,
                our four prototyped user tasks were able to achieve their promised functionalities. The reason for this
                is because we never reached the maximum severity of 4 (usability catastrophe) for any issue. In fact,
                our average severity for all 11 issues is 2.27. Nonetheless, we were determined to fix a few issues.</p>
            <p class='content-p'>First, let us discuss which issues we decided not to fix. Since our prototype has
                limited and controlled user actions, there is no way to break it in any way. As a result, we decided to
                leave the issues of not having error messages or help documentation for our next prototype iteration. As
                well, we decided not to fix issues that could not be fixed through our prototyping software, Figma, due
                to limitations of what can be prototyped in it. For example, one of our evaluators noted that there is
                no way to perform single-character deletion in our prototype’s search bar. But the reason for this is
                because we could not find an easy/built-in way to do this type of prototyping in Figma without using
                external plugins.</p>
            <p class='content-p'>Now, let us discuss which issues we decided to fix. Basically, we decided to fix the
                rest of our issues which were not mentioned in the previous paragraph. Most of them are just minor
                oversights and fixing them increases the quality of life of our users. So, it seemed reasonable to focus
                on these ones first. As for our solutions for fixing these issues, we were inspired heavily, if not
                completely, by what the evaluators wrote down in the “How can this rule further improve usability,
                utility, and desirability” column of their heuristic evaluations.</p>
