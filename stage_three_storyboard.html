            <h1>Storyboard</h1>
            <p>The question we sought to answer through storyboarding is, “how will a user find a movie or show to
                watch, using our service?” Out of our three most promising ideas, which we obtained from our affinity
                diagrams, we selected being able to “categorize movies by genre or streaming service” as the main idea
                for our storyboards. Through two storyboards that start off similarly but branch off into different
                scenarios, we further described how categorizing movies will be used by our users, as well as how it
                will facilitate our service’s tasks, especially being able to find movies and shows.</p>
            <h2 class='content-h2'>Storyboard 1</h2>
            <p class='content-p'>Our first storyboard begins with a couple who are at home on a Friday night. After a
                long and tiring week, the couple want to relax and watch a movie. However, like many times before, they
                are unsure of what to watch. As a result, they turn their computer on (which is connected to the TV) and
                go on our service. There, they scroll through the home page and are greeted by countless movies and
                shows categorized by genre. After a few minutes of browsing, they decide that they want to watch a
                Disney movie. As a result, they click on the “Browse by Streaming Service” button and the home screen
                automatically scrolls down to where the movies and shows are categorized by streaming service. There,
                they immediately see the Disney+ collection of movies and select “Star Wars” as the movie to watch.
                Through our service, the couple were able to browse through movies and shows, narrow down their
                preference to a specific streaming service, and select a movie, all with just a few clicks and without
                having to change streaming services.</p>

            <h2 class='content-h2'>Storyboard 2</h2>
            <p class='content-p'>Our second storyboard begins similarly, with a couple wanting to watch a movie on a
                Friday night. However, this time, the couple know exactly what they want to watch, which is a newly
                released movie. As a result, they search for the movie on the home page by scrolling down to the
                streaming service category to which it belongs. There, they select the movie and attempt to play it.
                However, since they have not linked their account for that streaming service to ours, they are quickly
                greeted with an option to link to our service. Once they finish linking, the “subscribe” button changes
                to “play”, allowing the couple to watch the newly released movie. Through our service, the couple were
                still able to find a movie to which they did not have access and were provided an option to link their
                account to that streaming service to ours. </p>
