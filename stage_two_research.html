            <h1>Research</h1>
            <h2 class='content-h2'>Activity Analysis</h2>
            <p class='content-p'>The first research method we chose was Activity Analysis. For this method, I
                compiled a list of things a user should be able to do on a streaming service, as well as while simply
                watching a movie at home, and selected three of the most significant ones to analyze.</p>
            <img src='images/jens-kreuter-ngMtsE5r9eI-unsplash.jpg'>
            <p class='content-p'>First, a user should be able to browse a continuously expanding library of movies and
                shows. By this, I mean the display, with all the movie and show thumbnails, should reveal more content
                as you scroll down. I think this is one of (if not) the easiest ways to showcase a library of media,
                since scrolling requires little to no attention from the user, allowing the user to focus more on the
                visually appealing thumbnails. Second, a user should be able to search for a specific movie or show
                without difficulty. Since streaming services contain countless movies and shows, which cannot be
                efficiently displayed all at once, a search function is essential. Finally, in terms of watching a movie
                at home, users should be able to not only watch with friends but also discuss with and see them. For
                this type of activity to be realized, a streaming service must implement social media features that
                provide a way to communicate through the service, as well as stream the same movie to multiple people
                synchronously.</p>
            <h2 class='content-h2'>Fly on the Wall</h2>
            <p class='content-p'>The second research method we chose was Fly on the Wall. For this method, I
                decided to watch a few shows with my roommates and see how they would interact with the myriad of
                streaming services to which they are subscribed.</p>
            <img src='images/mollie-sivaram-yubCnXAA3H8-unsplash.jpg'>
            <p class='content-p'>First, they browsed through the Netflix library, looking for an interesting show. While
                scrolling through the library, shows started automatically playing, which yielded a few complaints from
                my roommates. Unable to find a show on Netflix, my roommates decided to switch over to Disney+. After 10
                minutes of indecision, one of them suggested the show The Boys and searched it up. However, it was not
                on Disney+, so they had to search the internet to check which site it was on. This led them to Amazon
                Prime Video, where they found the show and started watching. Through this experience, I learned that
                picking something to watch is not always quick and easy, which often results in having to switch between
                sites. For instance, my roommates browsed through three different libraries before picking something.
                And they eventually selected a show that was quite trendy. Thus, they could have greatly benefited from
                an ability to sort or filter through movies and shows based on release date or popularity. They also
                suggested other shows they had heard of, but often did not know which site they were on, causing them to
                constantly search the internet and switch sites.</p>
            <h2 class='content-h2'>Scenario Testing</h2>
            <p class='content-p'>The third research method we chose was Scenario Testing. For this method, I
                created scenarios and asked people what they thought of them.</p>
            <img src='images/daria-nepriakhina-zoCDWPuiRuA-unsplash.jpg'>
            <p class='content-p'>The first scenario, which is the simplest solution to finding which streaming service
                has a movie, is to create a website with a database of movie titles and streaming services. In the
                database, movie titles will be linked to streaming services where they are available. As well, there
                will be a discussion section to fulfill the social aspect. Most participants found this scenario to be
                an acceptable solution but not one that they would regularly use. Though this approach would reduce the
                time spent in searching for movies and allow users to interact with other people, most participants
                would rather have their streaming services integrated into a website in a manner similar to YouTube
                where all content are searchable and viewable on one site. This brings us to the second scenario, which
                is to create an application with a similar database as in the first scenario but include all the video
                playing functions that a typical streaming service would have, as well as the actual media from the
                different streaming services. As for the social aspect, the application will not only include a
                discussion section but also a feature to allow users to comment on-screen in real time. Most
                participants said this was a better solution to accomplish streaming service compiling but raised
                concerns about copyright and spoilers.</p>
            <h2 class='content-h2'>Justification of Research Methods</h2>
            <p class='content-p'>We believe the research methods we chose will provide the insight required to design a
                streaming service compiler with social features since they highlighted similar issues regarding having
                to juggle multiple streaming services. We determined that having to switch streaming services to find a
                specific movie, or even just browse libraries, is something many people are not fond of. Furthermore, by
                using research methods from three different research method categories, we were able to obtain different
                perspectives on our project and the need for it. Through Activity Analysis, we determined which features
                are essential to our project from a developer’s perspective, while Fly on the Wall provided us firsthand
                information on issues customers were facing with current streaming services. And finally, with Scenario
                Testing, we were able to evaluate our initial ideas by asking potential users to react to them. Overall,
                our chosen research methods made research more focused and organized, and the information we obtained
                have made it easier for us to narrow down and refine our ideas.</p>
            <h2 class='content-h2'>What Went Well, What Went Poorly</h2>
            <p class='content-p'>As mentioned earlier, the research methods we chose provided us with a lot of
                information about how we should design the streaming service compiler. They allowed us to understand how
                users interact with current streaming services and think of ways to facilitate these interactions. We
                also gained information about potential issues with our idea, which should allow us to ensure that they
                are considered and avoided when creating our design. However, there were some limitations to how we
                could conduct our research. For instance, we could not use our chosen methods on a wide range of
                individuals because we had to abide by social distancing guidelines. This meant we could only gain
                insight from people who were very accessible, limiting the scope of our research.</p>
